You can use Oracle or any other DB (e.g., MySQL and PostgreSQL)for the project in which the submitted script should be executable. Besides from defining tables and constraints, this script may include views or indexes where appropriate. Please upload the script as a simple text file.• Application: the last deliverable is an Electronic Vendor Database Application that uses the relational schema defined in the first two deliverables. This application can be either a web or desktop application. Please feel free to use GitHub or BitBucket to manage/exchange the source codes with your teammates.• Submission (Tentative Deadline 05/05/2022): a report (including the ER Diagram, the screen shots of the application, each student’s contributions, and necessary description), source codes, and an SQL script file.• Demo (late April-early May): demo can be done via a face-to-face meeting (scheduling a 10-min timeslot with the instructor and the TAs) or video (taping a video for your application and sharing the link to the instructor and the TAs).</h3>",Sun May 01 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),,classes-and-styles

Please read <a href=""https://canvas.dartmouth.edu/courses/35219/files/5761905/download?wrap=1"">Caspary_1967_RichardsonModel.pdf</a><a href=""https://canvas.dartmouth.edu/courses/35219/files/5761905/download?download_frd=1""> </a></p><p><a href=""https://canvas.dartmouth.edu/courses/35219/files/5761905/download?download_frd=1""> Download Caspary_1967_RichardsonModel.pdf</a>for a full definition of the model. You can replace the time derivatives of x and y in the model with Delta x and Delta y to arrive at the discrete-time model described in class. For the following problems you can use either the discrete-time or continuous-time version.</p><p>Describe a limitation of the model and address that limitation by adding a nonlinear term or changing one of the existing terms to make it nonlinear. You will then need to describe what effect the modification has on Richardson's original findings regarding stability of arms races.</p><p>For the mathematical analysis of your model you will need to:</p><p>1) Find the fixed points analytically.</p><p>2) State the linearization around one of the fixed points (analytically, although you can substitute numerical quantities for all but one of the parameters to make this easier).</p><p>3) Find and classify a bifurcation point for one of the fixed points. This step can be carried out numerically by fixing all but one of the coefficients and performing a parameter sweep with the remaining coordinates. You can then either use Python or MATLAB to find the eigenvalues numerically or solve for the eigenvalues directly using Mathematica, Maple, Wolfram Alpha, or other symbolic math software. Create a plot that shows how the eigenvalues vary with the parameter. For real-valued eigenvalues, you could show the absolute values of each eigenvalue. For comlex eigenvalues you could plot the real part and the absolute value of one of the eigenvalues.</p><p> </p><p>Be sure to follow the writing guidelines presented earlier in the course. You should have an Intro, a section to describe the model, a section to describe the results, and a discussion. The intro should answer what question is being addressed, what previous work has been done (here, okay to just cite Richardson's model -- find a citation for the original model, but also cite the article you read that described the original paper), and what you are doing that is novel.</p><p>What you are doing is probably not actually all that novel because many people have already addressed shortcomings of the Richardson Model. That is okay. If you find a paper where somebody has already done what you are proposing, just cite them and say what is different about what you are doing. For instance you are illustrating the bifurcations numerically by performing parameter sweeps, and/or you are presenting the ideas differently, focusing on a different aspect as far as the analysis, etc. This is just a homework so it is quite okay to write a paper in which your contribution beyond what has already been done is exceedingly small. The main things that the homework is testing is whether you can carry out a stability analysis and whether you can write well about the stability analysis.</p>",Thu Mar 03 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),,content-management-system; classes-and-styles
